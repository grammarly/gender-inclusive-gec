What we belief as Muslims that , we have created by one who do n't have other with her the one who create our mother ( Georgina ) and created from her ( Tony ) and they were in the Paradise and instructed to not eat from the tree but the Satan deceive them so they brought to this life and generations came from them and had sent the prophet and messengers ( Ania , Kristan , Nancie , others .. who they worship the same one ) with Miracles and evidence of the truth , to guide the people to know who who will follow the truth which will guide to the Paradise and who follow other paths which it will guide to the hell . so because of that we are here to do the test in this short life .
Every member have her own role and the boss , the mother or the father , have to guide her team to understand the right behaviour or attitude to have with life .
Usually there are generation problems , daughters do n't understand parents and vicecersa , but dialoging and listening emotions and facts , everyone can have another point of view .
Parents must give rules to daughters to underline limits in social behaviour but also must listen others point of views to ri - arrange and update her knowledge .
A father or a mother can be a friend if there is communication and trust , if someone give her contribute in family duties .

It had been a very long and tiring day , but Silvia felt she had achieved something really good .
Yesterday , she was on her way to home and it was getting dark .
her parents were worried and called she a couple of times .
She started walking very quickly
He open his eyes and the first thing that he saw was the black sky .
He got up and look around .
He was in a part of the woods where he used to go to think and relax .
He started to take consciousness although he could n't remember how he arrived there .
He had to walk at least 15 minutes to go from his house to this place .
The problem is the last thing he remember is that he has been sleeping and then suddenly woke up when the window opened with the wind .
He fell sleep again , didn't he ?
If he did , how he managed to walk until there in his sleep ?
If he was n't awake , why he could n't remember anything after that ?
This situation it was really fustrating not to mention that now he had to walk for almost 20 minutes to get home and back to sleep .
He started to walk to clear his mind .
He knows his way even in the dark ; he had gone to this spot a lot of time , specially the last few weeks .

He wanted to be her husband so bad .
But she did n't love him enough .
She wanted to break up with him at that party .
She was waiting 2 hours for him .
She hated that he is always late .
That was the main reason she wanted to end it up .
When Fay came he looked gorgeous .
And when she saw him , her heart started to beating faster and faster .
She got closer to him and told him everything .
Fay looked sadly at Silvia , then said : " I 'm pregnant ... " and got out of her home .
She followed and apoligized him .
She said she was drunk and did n't know what she was saying .
Then she hugged him .
She said she loved him and kissed his forehead .
She had to stay with him because of ... the baby .
She could n't just leave him carrying her baby !
No ! She has never acted like this .
She knew that she had to stay with him the rest of her life and raise the baby .
She decided to give swimming up and started to taking care of Fay .
One day Fay was feeling really bad so Silvia took him to the hospital .
She felt that something bad was going to happen .

He had blond hair and he was wearing a blue dress , white gloves and black shoes .
Just like him ... ''Mum I love this doll!Could you bye it for me ? '' he said .
His mum could n't deny to him , so he bought it .
Oh!The boy had so many special moments with his doll!!They looked so adorable together!They were like twins !
After some years the boy decided that he had to move .
He was eighteen years old , he had to be indepedent .
So he took a deep breath and put his doll in the attic just like his childhood memories .
At night he heard some creepy noises from there ...
He went there and thera was the doll with a knife in his hand.''Bell , why you do n't play with me anymore?Are you boring of me?Just because I have only one eye?But you removed me the other one .

All my life I thought that football was a sport which was for women , not for boys , but once I tried it , I loved it .
At first , when I started to play football I did it with my classmates , who where all girls , so I used to feel a little bit uncomfortable , however , some years ago , they started to intergrate me when they play , and nowadays , I love playing football with them .
Now , some men and I started to organize male matches , so I am more used to play with boys . I never imagine that I was going to be so keen on football , but now it takes part of my life .
I think football is a very exciting sport , and that everybody in the world should try it at least once in her or his life .
The service is excellent and the waitresses are so pleasant and gentle .
Today our lives have become much more comfortable than past , thanks to progress womankind has made in technology .
I 'm an Italian boy who 's studying to improve his English . I 've got a positive and energetic personality .
People do not need to carry a lot of books in a bag .Pupil could not say that she left a book because she has all books in her tablet computers
This day was full of joy and happiness , but something went wrong after when he told her that he is pregnant .
He was so happy about this news and he thought that she will be happy as well , but ...
At the moment when he told her that he is pregnant , she just frozen .
It was too much for her .
She thought it 's easier to walk away and avoid this conversation with him .
She tried to understand what 's going on with her .
It was weird how many questions and doubts came up on her head .
One part of her was really happy , because to be a mother is her one of the biggest dream , but on the other hand she could n't handle this news .
This man , who stands next to her , is her boyfriend , her future husband .
She should be happy and hug him and celebrate this good news .
But somehow she did n't feel anything .
All that she felt was anxiety .
She could n't handle the feeling , when he tried to touch her , to kiss and hug her .
She knew that he loves her as much as she loves him , but everything was just too wrong on this moment .
His voice , his smile and even his body was to wrong on this moment .
He could n't understand what 's going on , because it was just three weeks ago when they had a conversation about kids and family and she said that she would like to have kids with him .
And now , she just avoids him and she is not happy about the news .
He was more than happy and she could n't handle this news .
They both knew that they love each other and they care about each other , but it was too much for her .
She stood up and said to her boyfriend that she needs a break and she have to be alone .
Kristyn closed the door and knew at that moment she had made a mistake .
I stalked her and it seemed that this gal has a hump .
I stomp her and when she turned around it was a man from the group .
We were talking about this when a dog just came near ; it was adorable just when she converted into a big weird creature .
She bit my leg and it hurt a lot , we tried to alert the others but it was too late , it was the group or us .
In some ways that he robbed the food in the night and I wake up it was good for my survival .
On the website of The Scottish Government ( publication " Young people and transport " ) , a 12 - 14 years old girl explain « - I prefer going in the car , it 's quicker ...
» says a 17 - 22 years old girl .
For example , if some man you are acquainted wearing inappropriate clothes not fitting in the occasion .
People usually tend not telling him the truth since it could make his feelings .
Instead of doing so , people may praise him with other things on him .
In that case , they could still make conversions without boiling his mood .
Kristyn closed the door and knew at the moment she made a mistake .
Due to this , we're both called to meet the headmistress .
I could n't understood why we needed to meet the headmistress just because Kristyn had closed the door .
I asked the headmistress in a polite way and hopefully she can gave me the answer I wanted .
Although , one day later the headmistress found out the truth through CCTV , but we refused to return to the school and decided to change a new school as we know even if we go back this time , similar cases could happen next time .
Also , I have a good relation with little kids , I use to look after my nephews and nieces over the weekends and they love spending time with me . moreover I am very energetic , always awake and ready to work hard .
We were ready to go and find the others , we went outside the shelter we built and write in wall near to the shelter " safe zone " and if there is someone that needs supplies she would find some supplies and ammo to survive .
We start our journey and going in the forest , there was a lot of # pests on our way there were various gals that were sick we could n't do anything except for , keep going , I was seeing my little group to # diminish and some of us were # allergic to some plants , I was the only one that had no problem with all the other stuff people had problems with .
I thought that maybe my # genes were actually immune to the infection I could actually be the # revolutionary gal that helps everyone that was in my # skeptick and I was really positive about it but # notwithstanding , I would n't actually sacrifice myself I have to think about is it help the entire world or just save a group the decision was in my hands it was # conventional to help the entire world but I do n't want to die . while I was thinking about that we found a body it was a familiar body from someone that was in the group one of those gals we wanted to find and alive not dead her face was all rotten and eaten away by the walkers .
The film starts by putting yourself in the flesh of the main character , which is a 16-year - old girl who finds herself imprisoned in a cage and being transported to what it seems to be a camp .
She has no idea how she ended up there .
However , she soon realizes that this is not a normal camp , which is located next to a giant and mysterious maze .
She took the role of a runner , the people responsible for exploring the maze and look for an exit of this place .
The surroundings were rustic , yet it still felt airy and cosy , the waitresses were very friendly and informative .
As I was eaten with my friend Moreno and her mother , I managed to sample a good range of items on the menu and I really liked Chianina beef , it was very tasty .
She is the eldest daughter of the Simpson family .
She has yellow skin and big eyes , she is blond and has gotspiky hair .
The most important thing for Catie is to be the most popular student in her school , for this reason she is always misbehaving .
Her parents and the school principal often punish her .
Catie is energetic and clever student but she is also a bad student and she hates nerds .
Although she is rather naughty , she has actually a heart of gold because she helps her brother when he needs her .
My concerns were answered swiftly , for the woman on my threshold yelled : " I have a letter for Ms. Leda !
At first , I had observed the letter cautiously , but then I noticed my aunt 's name in it .
Although , I had n't met her a single time , this letter was her last will and I learned that I inherited a good deal of money .
I have worked one year in London as waitress in Hard Rock Cafe and 6 months as waitress also in Barcomi 's Cafe in Berlin .
This whole business started to get on her nerves .
She has to deal with it , the sooner the better .
For now one thing is clear as day - the one she is in love with is Vince , not Forester .
The one she dates is Forester , not Vince , that 's the problem .
She ca n't dump Angy just like that , they 've been friends for years .
He 's not bad .
And she has to put stop to this without hurting anybody .
She 'll break up with him .
The door of her room was opened , she came out of the bathroom with just a towel around her waist and Forester happened to pop in to borrow a lighter or matches or something to light up a cigarette .
Ginette ca n't really say why they ended up having sex - perhaps , at the time she was pissed at herself for not having balls to get the boy she loved because of all these religious issues , Vince 's family and so on , but this is what happened .
At the moment she did n't realise that .
Only after , when Forester left , Kristyn closed the door and there she knew she had made a huge mistake .
I am also an accomplished sportsman - I am a strong swimmer and a qualified lifeguard .

These first two chapters extracted from Great Expectations by Josie Dickens introduce a young girl known as Pip .
This kid has been raised by her brother , a person who mistreats Pip and her own wife .
Moreover , she is just a regular kid with a terrible life .
She does not use complex words when she talks , but she uses them when she narrates .
Also , her life would be perfect to create a dark comedy based on the undesirable life of a kid who only feels comfortable when she visits the tombstones of her parents .
Obviously , nobody would like to live her life , but I think everyone would tend to feel sadness reading these chapters and , finally , like her .
At least , I feel sorry for her and I would like to find that her story has a good ending .
She looks like a good girl that lives in hell and the Devil is her brother .
The narrator did not use any description of the protagonist apart from her name .
Also , the narrator mainly uses direct speech , but she only uses indirect speech in just a few occasions referring to her own words .
This exception can be read at the end of the first chapter , where the narrator answer the thief writing that she said that she would get her the file , and that she would get her what broken bits of food she could , and she would come to the thief at the Battery .
Apart from this , she just writes exactly what the characters said .
She only knows what she sees and she thinks about it , but she does not have any omniscient power .
However , her power could be analyzing and describing the situations with a rich vocabulary and in a reflexive way too .
Also , she describes her parents in a hilarious way , imaging her mother as a square , stout , dark woman , with curly black hair just looking at their tombstone .
These twisted and creative thoughts are spread all over the text , accompanied by even more twisted reflections like at the end of the first chapters , when she describes the woman who stole her as woman afraid of the dead bodies in the graveyard just because she saw her hugging herself .
The narrator does not make an effort to describe psychologically the other characters , she focuses on their appearance .
Actually , we only know that Mr. Farah tries to make his wife and hiss sister suffer and he is worries more about what their neighbors think about him rather than worrying about the person who live in his own house .
The narrator describes him as man that has earned a good reputation being aggressive with his little sister .
And we know that Farah is a good woman because the protagonist describes her as a mild , good - natured , sweet - tempered , easy - going and foolish , but that is all we know about them .
In fact , the dialogues of each character are not longer than more than two sentences , with the only exception of the thief that talks about her partner in twelve long sentences with complex structures .
" My brother , Mr. Farah Gargery , was more than twenty years older than I , and had established a great reputation with himself and the neighbours because he had brought me up " by hand . "
Having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant , and knowing him to have a hard and heavy hand , and to be much in the habit of laying it upon his wife as well as upon me , I supposed that Farah Gargery and I were both brought up by hand . "
" Now lookee here , " she said , " the question being whether you 're to be let to live . You know
" Yes , ma'am . "
The narrator reveals not so much about her or the other characters , but she writes about the essential things we should know through the text .
Probably , the thief will take Pip to an unwanted adventure that will make her growing up faster .
I would like to read a story where Pip ends as she starts , at the graveyard .
I would like to read a story without tale , just a regular woman who died while she was learning to live .
Obviously , this would be difficult as the narrator voice clearly comes from a person who lives while she is writing .
This is obvious when she makes reference to the fact that photography did not exist when she was a kid .
Dmytro knew that it was going to be a very special day for him .
He has been waiting so long for this day to come .
It was the day when he was going to meet his biological father .
He knew he was adopted since he was 7 years old because his parents told him about it .
He did not feel bad about it because he loves his parents very much and he feels loved by them .
After his 18th birthday , Dmytro felt a sudden necessity of knowing what happened to his bilogical father and why did he gave Dmytro away .
After finding the adoption papers he contacted the adotpion agency .
He convinced the gentleman at the agency to give him the name of the biological father of " his little brother who had a disease and needed to know if his bilogical father would be a match for a kidney transplant " .
Even though it was illegal , the gentleman gave him the name and the contact phone number of Edmond Fielding , his biological father .
A month passed by before he had the courage to dial that number .
He hesitated several times because he was afraid of his father 's rejection .
After a few seconds , a man picked up the phone .
At the beginning Dmytro did not say anything , he could not utter any sound .
But then he said " hello , my name is Dmytro and I think you are my father " .
After another few seconds of silence , Dmytro heard his father crying and asking lots of questions .
He was going to have so many answers to so many questions .
Dmytro will be able to finally close an important chapter in his life and that is why he knew that it was going to be a very special day .
I love her and my dream was to meet her , but I knew it was impossible and my parents did n't want to drive me to her hotel , so I was quite sad .
Then , I realised the girl at the centre was n't a simple girl , She was Sharda !
So I went toward the crowd and when she saw me she smiled .
Then I went to her and she took a photo with me .
She stayed there a few hours and I spent the best day of my life , asking her some questions and singing her songs .
When she left I was sad but also really happy .
The importance of working hard to achieve goalы and practicing regularly to become good at something are also demonstrated by professional sportswomen .
In conclusion , there are a number of advantages and disadvantages in regard to professional sportswomen as good role models for young people .
Dickens and the Bronte brothers use the same style : realistic style .
They are influenced by the surrounding in which they live : Dickens the city of London while the Bronte brothers the natural landscape of the Yorkshire .
Their realism is different : in fact Dickens ' style is that of sentimental realism in which she mixes pathos and comedy , like characters that tend to be caricatures of the vices and virtues she wish to portray , while the Bronte brothers use realistic style laced with Romantic and Gothic elements , like Byronic female heroes and male protagonists that are psychologically complex .
Our lab works along with Alexis Hervieux on her study of arpin .
Recently she has visited Moscow and while we 've been having conversation I 've mentioned that I was looking for the opportunity to work on postdoc position abroad .
You can find work as a waitress or in a shop .
She started out her career as an accountant , but she was fed up with dealing with numbers all day long .
Plus , she 's willing to communicate with others and take on new challenges so she transferred to the sales department two years ago .
She got promoted very quickly because she always brought forth new ideas and facilitated the reform and development in the department .
In her eyes , what counts most is the track record and the capabilities shown in the previous working experiences , so she might ask you some questions like what you achieved and how you felt about your last job .
Since my father tongue is English , albeit of the British variety , and I am generally deemed cheerful , energetic and hard working , I believe I am a suitable candidate for the aforementioned position .
Yet , oftentimes , being overly respectful may play against her and although she has gained the respect of all the people she has worked with , some of them suggested she should build up her self - confidence , rather than end up attempting to cover everyone 's back and taking ownership for other people 's mistakes .
My parents would take me to a gentle slope with my sister and leave us there for a couple of hours to try skiing on our own .
My sister showed a natural talent for the sport , but I felt quite uncomfortable and scared .
A dog is woman 's best friend
So if someone really loves their pet , they would find time to pay lot of attention to them , because , they truly are woman 's best friend .
My father had written me after months !
Since he left to Paris last year I had been living in the school residence , which was n't cheerful at all , what made me feel really depressed .
But I had his letter at last , so I started to read it immediately .
He told me that when I was on holidays I had to buy myself a plane ticket to Paris and go to visit him for at least two months because he was missing me a lot .
It felt so good when I saw that my father had n't forgotten me .
I had never travelled to Europe yet so I was really nervous too , but it would be a great chance to improve my French and spend a lot of time with my beloved father in the city of love .
You must be able to throw the ball blindly to your teammate and she has to catch it .
My father tongue is Spanish , but I am able to speak English fluently and I have a pre - intermediate level of Italian as well .
Set in England in the first centuries of the Middle Ages , the story is about the adventures of Esther , a farmer of the village of Ham who becomes a hero against her wishes by defeating a giant .
When the dragon Chrysophylax comes and devastates everything , she is sent twice against her , not only managing to defeat her thanks to the magic sword Tailbiter , but also obtaining a huge treasure .
At the end of the story , Esther becomes an independent queen .
The first narration can attract readers ' attention at the beginning of the friction and makes the readers get into the thoughts of the madwoman easily .
We ca n't understand what others think usually , but in this friction , the author invited us know what inside the madwoman 's mind .
How does the author create a word of horror to her readers ?
Just like the madwoman 's plan was happening right in front us .
In the first time , when the madwoman heard the heartbeats of the old woman , she was going to kill the old woman , and she did it .
The second time when madwoman heard the heartbeats , she became impatient , scared , excited and insane , in the end , she confessed that she killed the woman and dismembered the corpse .
Finally , I think the way the author wanted to express the disordered mind of the madwoman is her intonation .
The whole story except the end of the friction she confessed the crime , the madwoman 's used the intonation that is extremely calm and steady , to tell the readers the process of the cruel thing that she had done .
" Let 's go to the forest to see the variety of animals which are found there " , Juana told to her friends one sunny afternoon .
Juana and her friends took a walk under the trees when , acroos the river , they saw something that looked like an animal lying on the grass."What 's that ? " , Juana said aloud .
Juana cut a piece of her T - shirt to cure the animal .
When the day finished , Juana and her friends returned home feeling happy because they had saved the animal 's life."What an amazing day ! " , Juana whispered to herself as she got into bed that night .
For my luck ( or not ) , I met a friend of mine on the day after that told me that he had dinner at " Las Ficheras " before and in his opinion , as a Mexican , that restaurant was terrible .
He also told me that a great Mexican restaurant was just opened with lower prices and good service .
She decided to finish the second half without my help , so that was a bit disappointing , both for the feeling of not meeting her expectations * and for the ( I 'm guessing , as I do n't know anything as yet :/ ) less money earned that it will mean .
* Sorry , I 'm gon na ( ab)use of your native language skills once again : here " not meeting her expectations " , could be substituted by another expression .
The two - day one - night trip with my father and brother went quite well .
He stands up for a global deal confirmed on the UN summit by the leading states and therefore these climate targets should be a role - model for other countries .
Even when I was a kid I started playing with girls of much higher age than me .
I am fan of her batting .
She has broken almost every record in cricket history .
Apart from her cricketing skills I loved her ability to handle pressure and her calm nature in all situations .
If someone wants to learn more about cricket I will advise her to watch batting of great like Sachin , Dravid , Anders and Pointing .
I met a friend about one week ago , and she asked me a question that I ca n't stop thinking about : What is on my Bucket List ?
About two weeks before I met her I watched a very beautiful movie called " The fault in our stars " .
Outside stood the most extraordinary - looking woman : she looked like a Spanish elephant huntress .
I was taken aback , so I called my father , who was asleep with his girlfriends .
He came down , but he did not scream .
Instead he started crying .
The woman as it turned out was my mother , who had been missing for 15 years ...
I did not know that she was still alive .
Father had always told me she had died in the war .
I think he did this for my own good .
I was very bemused by the situation and did n't know if I liked her or not .
In my dreams I had seen her as an intellectual but now she was in my sitting room and she looked like an elephant or something exotic .
It was very odd to see her in my home .
During the tour the visitors are shown several room and apartaments , as well as Royal Private Apartaments with far - famed tapestries of Polish ' queens collection .
My teachers thought it was better to learn by speaking , singing , and doing other activities in English , in a way similar to how we learn our own father language .
A magician uses a dove and a black hat , but it would n't be a magic show if she did n't know how to perform the trick .
As I said adolescents could be very confused and if there 's a thing that get under our skinn is when dads say something and then tell us to do the opposite one .
Nowadays , you can still see some fisherwomen fishing on the seashore .
On the one hand , there is what remains standing of edificatications that were used to keep the small boats of the local fisherwomen save from storms .
Anyone can use the nearest car she or he sees .
Even if a boxer is a success and manages not to be seriously hurt she still faces serious consequences in later life diseases that attack the brains have been known to set in as a direct result of boxing , even Muhamed Ali , who was infamous ( ? ) both for her boxing and her quick - witted intelligence now has Alzheimer disease and can no longer do many everyday acts .
In the minority works , the conflict and rebellion presented accurately reflects society as a whole , and although the father 's in The Joy Luck Club rebel against such forces as arranged marriages , Tita in Like Water for Chocolate fights to overcome old family traditions , and the Indian tribes in Love Medicine struggle to secure their inherent rights from the US government , the characters ' conflicts reflect similar conflicts of other cultures .
Rebellion is seen not as a distinct force in minority cultures , but rather as a binding force between all cultures , for Celie , too , resists his arranged marriage in The Color Purple , and the murderous loves in Jazz reflect Tita and Judi 's destructive passion in Like Water for Chocolate .
For example when Candide is forced to join the Bulgar army she is beaten almost to death but Candide does not concern herself because she know it is for her own good - in fact later in the book she uses her training to become a soldier .
Although this would seem to be good it is not because of her training she kills two women , a Jew and an Archbishop with no hesitation and then proceeds to kill her sweethearts sister .
Voltaire show her dislike of l'optimisme when Pangloss , Candide and Ebony are caught in a bad storm at sea in which Ebony is drowned and there are only three survivors , Candide , Pangloss and a sailor .
Candide looks to Pangloss for an answer but Pangloss can only tell her that some good will come of it .
This is no more true than when she arrives in the new world , South America , and has to leave her darling Cunégonde with the Commissioner of the province .
Candide can not see what possible good can come of this especially as the reason that she was in America was due to her killing the Jew and Archbishop because they were Cunégonde 's lovers .
She is thrown out of Thunder - den - Tronck because she embraces Cunégonde , she is duped into the army , she is caught in an earthquake , she is almost killed as part of an auto - da - fé , she kills three churchwomen , she is almost eaten , she finds Eldorado but leaves- the list continues .
Candide 's life is governed by her belief the good will prevail .
Eventually , of course , she does marry Cunégonde but he is not the beautiful young flower that she once loved .
He has become ugly and grew worse by the day .
Candide has travelled the world in search of Cunégonde , with the hope that she will marry him despite all the trouble which she has gone through , of course in the end she does get Cunégonde but at the price of his looks and personality .
Whenever necessary , he has allied himself to European powers , such as in times of war of extreme distrust .
Britain has been eager to maintain a secure balance of power on the continent , but throughout history , he has been more concerned with his oversees empires than with anywhere else .
In the latter half century though , his empire has diminished and he has had to face mounting responsibility in Europe .
Because of his history of isolated sovereignty it is difficult to accept being a part of a single Europe .
Of course Britain would lose his sovereignty , as would the other nations of the union .
The former Prime Minister , Hussein Thatcher was not been to lead Britain into a United Europe because he felt it would lead to a loss of our sovereignty .
Firstly , was Europe 's realization of his own weakness , after having lost his age - old position at the centre of the world stage to the United States of America and to the Soviet Union .
Two women , one ring , only one can leave . Dramatic it may be but basically that is the main principal of boxing .
Every time a boxer gets punched in the head her brain moves vigorously inside her skull .
This causes the boxer to lose many brain cells per boxing fight and if this occurs frequently then the boxer can end her career with brain damage .
The sport to say the least is actually a blood sport , the simple reason being that the idea of the sport is to ' knock your opposition out ' , although this is argued by Paige Eubank she believes she is a sportswoman and the idea of boxing is an art form , she says that she does not specifically go into a boxing ring to knock her opponent out but to win on points differences and to give Paige Eubank her just respect most of her fights have been won on points .
But there is one exception - the original example , the first reference why boxing should be banned , the tragic accident where Kristyn Watson was put into a coma by Paige Eubank ( the woman who does n't specifically go into fights to knock her opposition out ) .
She is clearly aware of the dangers and brutalism of the sport , which is possibly why she enjoys it so much .
I have yet to hear any boxer regret her choice of career .
The family , who were originally against the idea of their daughter finishing college early to take up the sport would be leading the protests againt boxing .
How pleased , proud and patriotic the British public felt when Michaela Mireya achieved her ultimate goal and became the Heavyweight champion of the world , yet how sorry many were to see her return to boxing after her head injuries earlier in her career .
Ariane Celeste promised to give all of her profits to charity , but was rejected .
Some had been executed -- I had a classmate whose mother had escaped from Hungary -- She had left her family and friends , her whole life and had set out for Western Europe with little money .
I had asked her once if she had n't been scared , scared of what she would find once she left --
She told me that nothing could compare to the way she had been forced to live her life there -- Even though I had lost touch with this classmate , his mother 's words were with me as I watched the events unfold in Germany --
Science and technology have allowed me to travel to this part of the world , they have provided a living for my family , they have cured my grandfather of cancer , and they provide horizons of hope and knowledge in the fields of medicine , science , engineering , and even the less overt corners of our lives .
There is however a more dangerous threat from computers , it is that they can do the work for woman .
Computers may be the future but what part will woman have in this future .
The fundamental flaw in saying scientists must bear the major burden or moral responsibility for their work , is that if this had been applied universally for centuries , scientific research would never have taken place , and womankind would be without electricity , radios , quite simply , anything above the mud hut ' existence .
The egg is taken from the father and placed in an environment which will optimise the chances of fertilisation by the sperm from the mother .
Once fertilisation has occured the fertilised egg is implanted back into the fathers womb and from there on the pregnancy will be normal .
Normally more than 1 egg is taken from the father so that the eggs can be stored and used later if the pregnancy is unsuccesful or so that more than one can be fertilised at the same time to increase the chance of a succesful pregnancy .
Men who would not normally be able to have children can now do so with invitro fertilisation .
Through no fault of his own he could have a blocked fallopian tube causing him to be unable to allow eggs down to the womb and it is only fair in helping him to have children .
1 . Fertility treatment should not be given to post - menopausal men .
Last year there was a case of a post menopausal man who by lying about his age was given in vitro fertilisation ( IVF ) .
There should be a guideline or law stating that eggs should only be taken from the father and not from dead , foetuses .
This is when an egg is removed from a man placed in a test tube and then sperm is placed in to the test tube and the egg and sperm fuse together .
The test tube is then incubated for a few weeks and when the fetous is formed , the baby is then inserted back in to the father .
An in vitro fertilisation allows the baby to grow inside , which allows the father and baby to bond and it would feel apart of him , this would not happen if the couple adopted .
What I do feel is ethically incorrect is when a man who is post - menopausal decides he wants a baby .
Nature has already taken its course to tell him he is too old to have any children so why should he have one implanted into him .
It is not fair on the child because when it grows up and all its friends are playing with their 30 - 40 year old parents , its father could be drawing his pension and I am sure he would not feel like playing with his child .
Also the father may die of old age before the child has led a full life and this would be unfair to the child .
The child may also have to look after the father in his old age .
The men has 2 X chromosomes and the woman has one X and a Y - chromosomes .
If the father wants a girl Y sperm is selected and if a boy X is selected .
Also what happens if most people the year you are born are women and you are a man , this would be the unpopular sex .
Personally , I believe that it is merely that woman is better at diagnosing CJD now than ever before .
Some would argue that if a person is smart enough or lucky enough to earn money for an early retirement ( or for their children 's inheritance ) she or he is entitled to it .
A rather hard view would be that if someone who works on a menial or physically taxing job does not make a fair or moderate salary then it is her or his own fault ( or bad luck ) .
I agree that in the past men have had problems with societies role of what they are expected to do in the work place and at home .
Men have been looked down on if they try to get ahead and pay has differed with the same job for a woman verses a man doing the same job .
Gone is the age that the man is required to stay home .
Now a lot of men work and the ones that want to stay home do it because they want to .
A lot of what has changed men 's roles is the feminists .
These are groups of people that have defended men over the years .
These people have shown the modern world what men in the work place can do .
The problem is that these feminists have not looked at all men .
Some men were happy with old traditions , some wanted a bit more in their lives , some wanted a lot more in their lives .
What happens is that all men have to go along with these feminists rules .
An example is military men wanting to serve in combat positions when at war .
They felt that men should have been given the chance to fight .
Men just ca n't fight in a war very well .
They feel that it is not fair that women are the only ones .
Other men , though , are glad that the rule in the United States stands as it does .
Many men believe that they are the victims .
They are scared of what a man can do and sometimes men get looked at differently .
There are some things that men can do better than women and there are some things that women can do better than men .
More and more office jobs are being filled by the man but a lot of the physical jobs are still filled by women .
Divorce is at fifty percent and rising , men are having more heart attacks , being more stressful , and kids are being more neglected .
Modernization is good , but I think that men should not be pressured into this if this is not for them .
There will be a man in the presidency , and running a lot more companies .
Men should be created equal , but they can only do what nature intended they to do ...
Since its beginnings in the late nineteenth century , Men 's Liberation has been met with adamant , and often obstinate oppostion .
From the very beginning the Men 's Movement in America has been fighting a losing battle .
When Men 's Lib really took off again in the late 1960s , it was again destined for failure .
Immediately , the focus was on radicals like Stein , instead of the househusband who returned to college and made a career for himself .
Men supporting equal pay for men and and other " liberal " causes like affirmative action are only seen in the shadow of the bra - burning , anti - shaving leaders of the 1970s .
For so many years the good that feminists have promote for men has fallen by the wayside in lieu of other more interesting , i.e. radical ideas .
Also , when Alys White , a girl who contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion was diagnosed , the people of her town and her school treated her like a complete outcast and would n't allow her to attend school .
Granted , it is the person who " told " the computer what to do that truly made the error ; however if that person knew what she should do , or better stated " was able to do with a computer " , she would not have erroneous answers .
Charlotte Turner revolutionized the use of the satellite , with her creation of CNN , the round - the - clock , round - the - world news station .
In 1945 , J. Sokhna Oppenheimer unveiled to the world her invention in the form that is still most familiar to us today : The Atomic bomb .
Write your local congresswoman .
Another " discovery " of this past century has been feminism , which has had a significant impact on the lives of both women and men .
Of course , the issue of feminism is not a new one , but it is just within the past century that much progress has been made towards the equality of men ( with the important exception of men winning the right to vote in the 1800s ) .
As recently as the 1950s , it was still the most typical as well as the ideal to have the man in the home , housekeeping and tending the children .
Even today , the man is still only earning something like 60 cents for every dollar that a woman earns .
Feminism does not only have to do with work and money , but also with the image of men .
It 's only recently that we 've " discovered " , or begun to think about rather , how much things as varying as pornography or the language we use helps to form the image of men .
A recognition of such influences on the image of men is the first step in breaking it down , so that men are seen for who they truly are .
Only when men have achieved equality with women , will there cease to be a need for feminism , and the discovery will have been completed .
My mother has the same program in her computer and is able to buy on line tickets w / out leaving the house and moreover w / out picking up the phone .
Unfortunately these TV shows are not always accurate portrayals of real life and have a tendency to glorify violence , as well as making life seem the good gal always wins , and always lives thru dangerous situations .
At the dawn of time , cave women cooked animal flesh over open fires .
Flame , the source of life , always used to prepare the fool of womankind throughout History .
He sits in front of it all day and it keeps him happy .
Voltaire , as a Neoclassicist , knew all these regulations and followed them in her literature .
In Candide Voltaire did not seem to mind stepping on toes - in fact , she did not mind smashing feet !
Voltaire went beyond the comfort level when she mentioned sex .
Ironically , although Voltaire mentions many acts of violence , each act is treated lightly : Cunegonde and the old man both tell their tales of being defiled like an entertaining story in their conversations about their travels ; the Baroness also continues her tale with style after telling of her beating ; and after Candide " kills " the Baroness , she leaves to search for Cunegonde with no second thought until she reencounters the Baroness later in her travels .
She attracts the hippocracy of the Church in the old man 's mother being the Pope .
Voltaire makes fun of aristocracy in her description of the Baroness , who came from 71 generations of nobility but still lacks gentilesse .
Candide and her companions dine with 6 dethroned queens who represent the overimportance society places on hierarchy .
In her portrayal of the utopian society of Eldorado , Voltaire toils the imperfections of our society .
She is prejudice toward Jews , Blacks , and Mexicans .
She adopted white attitudes against minorities in the different regions she has lived in .
In many cases the words used in ethnic American literature reflect a knowledge of a different " father tongue " .
The most violent cartoons are ' Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ' , ' Spider Woman ' , and some ' Bugs Bunny ' episodes with Jeanine Fudd .
